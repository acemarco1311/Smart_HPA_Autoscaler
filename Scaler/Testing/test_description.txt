Locust:
- Input: total concurrent users, spawn rate, total running time.
- Output: request per second, failure rate, etc (response time)

Resource request and limit of each microservice.

Some considerations:
    Microservice keep getting crashed because getting over resource limit?
    Smart HPA not fast enough? -> Terminate because over limit?
    Smart HPA scale so tight? -> Terminate because over limit?


test_one:
capacity running time = 300s,
0s delay between resource exchange
Locust: 100 users, 0.2 users/second, total runtime = 300
Microservice: 15m/120Mi -> 20m/200Mi
Target utilization: 80% -> 0.8 * 15 = 12m
min rep = 1
max rep = 5
--> No resource constraints.
--> No effect to Smart HPA correctness


test_two:
capacity running time = 300s
0s delay between resource exchange
Locust: 100 users, 0.2 users/second, total runtime = 300
Microservice: 15m/120Mi -> 20m/200Mi
Target utilization: 80% -> 0.8 * 15 = 12m cpu
min rep = 1
max rep = 2
